    "## Kubernetes and Overshift Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few years, Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard platform for the management, orchestration, and provisioning of container based cloud native computing applications. Cloud native computing applications are essentially applications that are built from a collection of smaller services (i.e., microservices) and take advantage of the speed of development and scalability capabilities that cloud computing environments typically provide. In this time Kubernetes has matured to provide the controls required to manage even more advanced and stateful workloads such as databases and AI services. The Kubernetes ecosystem continues to experience explosive growth and the project benefits greatly from being a multiple-vendor and meritocracy-based open source project backed by a solid governance policy and level playing field for contributing.      \n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many Kubernetes distributions available for customers to choose from, the Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes distribution is of particular interest. OpenShift has achieved broad adoption across a variety of industries and currently has over 1000 enterprise customers across the globe utilizing it to host their business applications and drive their digital transformation efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kubernetes: Cloud Infrastructure for Orchestrating Containerized Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "With the emergence of Docker in 2013, numerous developers were introduced to containers and container based application development.  Containers were introduced as an alternative to virtual machines (VMs) as a means of creating self-contained units of deployable software.  Containers rely on advanced security and resource management features provided by the Linux operating system to provide isolation at the process level instead of relying on VMs for creating deployable units of software.  A Linux process is much more lightweight and orders of magnitude more efficient than a virtual machine for common activities like starting up an application image or creating new image snapshots.  Because of these advantages, containers were favored by developers as the desired approach to create new software applications as self-contained units of deployable software.  As the popularity of containers grew, there became a need for a common platform for the provisioning, management, and orchestration of containers.  For more than a decade, Google had embraced the use of Linux containers as the foundation for applications deployed in its cloud.   Google had extensive experience orchestrating and managing containers at scale and had developed three generations of container management systems: Borg, Omega, and Kubernetes.  Kubernetes was the latest generation of container management developed by Google.  It was a redesign based upon lessons learned from Borg and Omega, and was made available as an open source project.  Kubernetes delivered several key features that dramatically improved the experience of developing and deploying a scalable container-based cloud application:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declarative deployment model\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cloud infrastructures that existed before Kubernetes were released provided a procedural approach based on a scripting language such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and so on for automating the deployment of applications to production environments.  In contrast, Kubernetes used a declarative approach of describing what the desired state of the system should be.  Kubernetes infrastructure was then responsible for starting new containers when necessary (e.g., when a container failed) to achieve the desired declared state.  The declarative model was much more clear at communicating what deployment actions were desired, and this approach was a huge step forward compared to trying to read and interpret a script to determine what the desired deployment state should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built in replica and autoscaling support\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cloud infrastructures that existed before Kubernetes, support for replicas of an application and providing autoscaling capabilities were not part of the core infrastructure and, in some cases, never successfully materialized due to platform or architectural limitations. Autoscaling refers to the ability of a cloud environment to recognize that an application is becoming more heavily utilized and the cloud environment automatically increases the capacity of the application, typically by creating more copies of the application on extra servers in the cloud environment.  Autoscaling capabilities were provided as core features in Kubernetes and dramatically improved the robustness and consumability of its orchestration capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built in rolling upgrades support\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cloud infrastructures do not provide support for upgrading applications. Instead, they assume the operator will use a scripting language such as Chef, Puppet or Ansible to handle upgrades.  In contrast, Kubernetes actually provides built in support for rolling out upgrades of applications.  For example, Kubernetes rollouts are configurable such that they can leverage extra resources for faster rollouts that have no downtime, or they can perform slower rollouts that do canary testing, reducing the risk and validating new software by releasing software to a small percentage of users, to ensure the new version of the application is stable.  Kubernetes also provides support for the pausing, resuming, and rolling back the version of an application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improved networking model\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes mapped a single IP address to a Pod, which is Kubernetes smallest unit of container aggregation and management.  This approach aligned the network identity with the application identity and simplified running software on Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in health-checking support\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes provided container health checking and monitoring capabilities that reduced the complexity of identifying when failures occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with all the innovative capabilities available in Kubernetes, many enterprise companies were still hesitant to adopt this technology because it was an open source project supported by a single vendor.  Enterprise companies are careful about what open source projects they are willing to adopt and they expect open source projects such as  Kubernetes to have multiple vendors contributing to it, and they also expect open source projects to be meritocracy-based with a solid governance policy and a level playing field for contributing.  In 2015, the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) was formed to address these issues facing Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Cloud Native Computing Foundation Accelerates the Growth of the Kubernetes Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, the Linux Foundation initiated the creation of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).  The CNCF’s mission is to make cloud native computing ubiquitous.  In support of this new foundation, Google donated Kubernetes to the CNCF to serve as its seed technology.  With Kubernetes serving as the core of its ecosystem, the CNCF has grown to more than 440 member companies, including Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Red Hat, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Docker, Microsoft Azure, VMware, Intel, Huawei, Cisco, Alibaba Cloud, and many more.  In addition, the CNCF ecosystem has grown to hosting 26 open source projects, including Prometheus, Envoy, GRPC, etcd, and many others.  Finally, the CNCF also nurtures several early stage projects and has eight projects accepted into its Sandbox program for emerging technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the weight of the vendor-neutral CNCF foundation behind it, Kubernetes has grown to having more than 3,200 contributors annually from a wide range of industries.  In addition to hosting several cloud-native projects, the CNCF provides training, a Technical Oversight Board, a Governing Board, a community infrastructure lab, and several certification programs to boost the ecosystem for Kubernetes and related projects. As a result of these efforts, there are currently over 100 certified distributions of Kubernetes.  One of the most popular distributions of Kubernetes, particularly for enterprise customers, is Red Hat’s OpenShift Kubernetes. In the next section, we introduce OpenShift, and provide an overview of the key benefits it provides for developers and IT Operations teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenShift: Red Hat’s Distribution of Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "While there have certainly been a large number of companies that have contributed to Kubernetes,  the contributions from Red Hat are particularly noteworthy.  Red Hat has been a part of the Kubernetes ecosystem from its inception as an open source project and it continues to serve as the second largest contributor to Kubernetes.   Based on this hands-on expertise with Kubernetes, Red Hat provides its own distribution of Kubernetes that they refer to as OpenShift.  OpenShift is the most broadly deployed distribution of Kubernetes across the enterprise.  It provides a 100% conformant Kubernetes platform, and supplements it with a variety of tools and capabilities focused on improving the productivity of developers and IT Operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenShift was originally released in 2011.  At that time it had its own platform-specific container runtime environment.  In early 2014, the Red Hat team had meetings with the container orchestration team at Google and learned about a new container orchestration project that eventually became Kubernetes.  The Red Hat team was incredibly impressed with Kubernetes and OpenShift was rewritten to use Kubernetes as its container orchestration engine.   As result of these efforts, OpenShift was able to deliver a 100% conformant Kubernetes platform as part of its version three release in June of 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Kubernetes with additional supporting capabilities to make it operational for enterprise needs.  OpenShift instead differentiates itself from other distributions by providing long term (3+ year) support for major Kubernetes releases,  security patches,  and enterprise support contracts that cover both the operating system and the OpenShift Kubernetes platform.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux has long been a de-facto distribution of Linux for organizations large and small. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform builds on Red Hat Enterprise Linux to ensure consistent Linux distributions from the host operating system through all containerized function on the cluster. In addition to all these benefits, OpenShift also enhances Kubernetes by supplementing it with a variety of tools and capabilities focused on improving the productivity of both developers and IT Operations.  The following sections describe these benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of OpenShift for Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "While Kubernetes provides a large amount of functionality for the provisioning and management of container images, it does not contain much support for creating new images from base images, pushing images to registries, or support for identifying when new versions become available.  In addition, the networking support provided by Kubernetes can be quite complicated to use.  To fill these gaps,  OpenShift provides several benefits for developers beyond those provided by the core Kubernetes platform: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Source to Image\n",
    "When using basic Kubernetes, a cloud native application developer owns the responsibility of creating their own container images.  Typically, this involves finding the proper base image and creating a Dockerfile with all the necessary commands for taking a base image and adding in the developers code to create an assembled image that can be deployed by Kubernetes.  This requires the developer to learn a variety of Docker commands that are used for image assembly.  With OpenShift’s Source to Image (S2I) capability,  OpenShift is able to handle the merging of the cloud native developers code into the base image.  In many cases,  S2I can be configured such that all the developer needs to do is commit their changes to a git repository and S2I will see updated changes and merge the changes with a base image to create a new assembled image for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pushing Images to Registries\n",
    "Another key step that must be performed by the cloud native developer when using basic Kubernetes is that they must store newly assembled container images in an image registry such as Docker Hub.  In this case, the developer need to create and manage this repository.  In contrast, OpenShift provides its own private registry and developers can use that option or S2I can be configured to push assembled images to third party registries. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image Streams\n",
    "When developers create cloud native applications, the development effort results in a large number of configuration changes as well as changes to the container image of the application.  To address this complexity, OpenShift provides the Image Stream functionality that monitors for configuration or image changes and performs automated builds and deployments based upon the change events.   This feature removes from the developer the burden of having to take out these steps manually whenever changes occur.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base Image Catalog\n",
    "OpenShift provides a base image catalog with a large number  of useful base images for a variety of tools and platforms such as WebSphere Liberty, JBoss,  php, redis, Jenkins, Python, .NET, MariaDB, and many others.  The catalog provides trusted content that is packaged from known source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Routes\n",
    "Networking in base Kubernetes can be quite complicated to configure, OpenShift provides a Route construct that interfaces with Kubernetes services and is responsible for adding Kubernetes services to an external load balancer. Routes also provide readable URLs for applications and also provides a variety of load balancing strategies to support several deployment options such as blue-green deployments, canary deployments, and A/B testing deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "While OpenShift provides a large number of benefits for developers,  its greatest differentiators are the benefits it provides for IT Operations.   In the next section we describe several of its core capabilities for automating the day to day operations of running OpenShift in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of OpenShift for IT Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In May of 2019, Red Hat announced the release of OpenShift 4.   This new version of OpenShift was completely rewritten to dramatically improve how the OpenShift platform is installed, upgraded, and managed.  To deliver these significant lifecycle improvements, OpenShift heavily utilized in its architecture the latest Kubernetes innovations and best practices for automating the management of resources. As a result of these efforts, OpenShift 4 is able to deliver the following benefits for IT Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Installation\n",
    "OpenShift 4 support an innovative installation approach that is automated, reliable, and repeatable.  Additionally,  the OpenShift 4 installation process supports full stack automated deployments and can handle installing the complete infrastructure including components such as Domain Name Service (DNS) and the Virtual Machine (VM). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Operating System and OpenShift Platform Updates\n",
    "OpenShift is tightly integrated with the lightweight RHEL CoreOS operating system which itself is optimized for running OpenShift and cloud native applications.  Thanks to the tight coupling of OpenShift with a specific version of RHEL CoreOS,  the OpenShift platform is able to manage updating the operating system as part of its cluster management operations.  The key value of this approach for IT Operations is that it supports automated, self-managing, over-the-air updates.  This enables OpenShift to support cloud-native and hands-free operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Cluster Size Management\n",
    "OpenShift supports the ability to automatically increase or decrease the size of the cluster it is managing.  Like all Kubernetes clusters, an OpenShift cluster has a certain number of worker nodes on which the container applications are deployed.  In a typical Kubernetes cluster,  the adding of worker nodes is an out of band operation that must be handled manually by IT Operations.  In contrast,  OpenShift provides a component called the Machine Operator that is capable of automatically adding worker nodes to a cluster.  An IT Operator can use a MachineSet object to declare the number of machines needed by the cluster and OpenShift will automatically perform the provisioning and installation of new worker nodes to achieve the desired state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Cluster Version Management\n",
    "OpenShift, like all Kubernetes distributions,  is composed of a large number of components.   Each of these components have their own version numbers.  To update each of these components, OpenShift relies on a Kubernetes innovation called the operator construct to manage updating each of these components.  OpenShift uses a cluster version number to identify which version of OpenShift is running and this cluster version number also denotes which version of the individual OpenShift platform components needs to be installed as well.  With OpenShift’s automated cluster version management,  OpenShift is able to automatically install the proper versions of all these components to ensure that OpenShift is properly updated when the cluster is updated to a new version of OpenShift.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multicloud Management Support\n",
    "Many enterprise customers that use OpenShift  have multiple clusters and these clusters are deployed across multiple clouds or in multiple data centers.  In order to simplify the management of multiple clusters,  OpenShift 4 has introduced a new unified cloud console that allows customers to view and manage multiple OpenShift clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenShift and the capabilities it provides becomes extremely prominent when it’s time to run in production and IT operators need to address operational and security related concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This overview of both Kubernetes and OpenShift including the historical origins of both platforms. The key benefits provided by both Kubernetes and OpenShift that have driven the huge growth in popularity for these platforms.  As a result,  this chapter has helped us to have a greater appreciation for the value that Kubernetes and OpenShift provide cloud native application developers and IT operation teams. Thus, it is no surprise that these platforms are experiencing explosive growth across a variety of industries.  In the next chapter we build a solid foundational overview of Kubernetes and OpenShift that encompasses presenting the  Kubernetes architecture, discussing how to get Kubernetes and OpenShift production environments up and running, and several key Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts that are critical to running successfully in production."
